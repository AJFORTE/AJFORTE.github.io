Let's analyze the `restaurant_data`` data:

## Variable Description for `restaurant_data`` data.frame

The following describes the variables in the `restaurant_data`` data.frame.


 `CAMIS`:
 
   -   This is an unique identifier for the entity (restaurant);
   
   -   10-digit integer
   
 `DBA`:
 
   -   This field represents the name (doing business as) of the entity (restaurant);
   
   -   Public business name, may change at discretion of restaurant owner
   
 `BORO`:
 
   -   Borough in which the entity (restaurant) is located.;
   
   -   • `1` = MANHATTAN
   -   • `2` = BRONX
   -   • `3` = BROOKLYN
   -   • `4` = QUEENS
   -   • `5` = STATEN ISLAND
   -   • `0` = Missing;
   
 `CUISINE DESCRIPTION`:
 
   -   This field describes the entity (restaurant) cuisine.
   
 `ACTION`:
 
   -   This field represents the actions that is associated with each restaurant inspection. ;
   
   -   • Violations were cited in the following area(s).
   
   -   • No violations were recorded at the time of this inspection.
   
   -   • Establishment re-opened by DOHMH
   
   -   • Establishment re-closed by DOHMH
   
   -   • Establishment Closed by DOHMH.
   
   -   • Violations were cited in the following area(s) and those requiring immediate action were addressed.
   
 `VIOLATION CODE`:
 
   -   Violation code associated with an establishment (restaurant) inspection
   
 `VIOLATION DESCRIPTION`:
 
   -   Violation description associated with an establishment (restaurant) inspection
   
 `CRITICAL FLAG`:
 
   -   Indicator of critical violation;
   
   -   • `Critical`
   -   • `Not Critical`
   -   • `Not Applicable`;
   
   -   Critical violations are those most likely to contribute to food-borne illness
   
 `SCORE`:
 
   -   Total score for a particular inspection;
   
 `GRADE`:
 
   -   Grade associated with the inspection;
   
   -   • `N` = Not Yet Graded
   -   • `A` = Grade A
   -   • `B` = Grade B
   -   • `C` = Grade C
   -   • `Z` = Grade Pending
   -   • `P` = Grade Pending issued on re-opening following an initial inspection that resulted in a closure


## Purchase Patterns

We'll explore the purchase patterns in the dataset. This includes understanding the most popular brands, the average quantity purchased, and spending habits across different markets. Here are some specific analyses we can perform:

- Calculate the total quantity and spending for each brand.

- Find the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase.

- Compare the total spending across different markets.

I'll begin with these analyses and create visualizations to help us understand the data better. Let's start with a quick data summary

```{r}
restaurant_data %>% group_by(GRADE) %>% skim(SCORE) %>% select(-n_missing)
```

#Critical Grading

Starting off with a histogram showing the distribution of scores varies by grade and critical flag

```{r}
ggplot(restaurant_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = SCORE), binwidth = 1 ) +
  facet_wrap( `CRITICAL FLAG` ~ GRADE, scales = 'free' )
```


For the most part these graphs show:
The values of SCORE for GRADE A ranges from 0 to 13.
The values of SCORE for GRADE B ranges 13 to 27.
The values of SCORE for GRADE C ranges 24 to 75.
For Not Critical type, two SCORE values around 1 and 12 are most common, while 12 is the single most common SCORE value for Critical type.

# Proportions

Now, let's visualize the proportion of grade and borough

```{r}
ggplot(restaurant_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = `CRITICAL FLAG`,
               y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +
  facet_grid( GRADE ~ BORO ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

This simply depicts:
- For GRADE A, the probability distribution of CRITICAL FLAG are similar across BOROs.
- For GRADE B, the restaurants in Staten Island are more likely to be Critical than in other BOROs.
- For GRADE C, the restaurants in Bronx are more likely to be Critical than in other BOROs.


#Distribution of Grades

Next, we'll look at the total grades and what they are based on the different boroughs around the city

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(restaurant_data, aes(x = GRADE, fill = as.factor(BORO))) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  labs(x = 'Grade',
       y = 'Count',
       fill = 'Borough') +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")

```

In this plot, each bar represents the count of different grades (GRADE) for each borough (BORO). The bars are stacked, and the fill color represents the borough distribution within each grade category. This visualization allows you to compare how different grades are distributed across different boroughs. The scale_fill_brewer function is used to set a color palette for the boroughs. You can adjust the palette according to your preference.
