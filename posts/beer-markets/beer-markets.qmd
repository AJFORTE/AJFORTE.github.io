Let's analyze the `beer_data` data:

```{r}
beer_data <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv")
```


```{r}

## Variable Description for `beer_data` data.frame

The following describes the variables in the `beer_data` data.frame.


- `hh`: Household identifier
- `_purchase_desc`: Description of the purchase
- `quantity`: The quantity of beer purchased
- `brand`: The brand of beer
- `dollar_spent`: The amount spent
- `beer_floz`: Fluid ounces of beer
- `price_per_floz`: Price per fluid ounce
- `container`: Type of container
- `promo`: Whether the purchase was on promotion
- `market`: The market where the purchase was made
- Demographics: `age`, `employment` status, `degree`, class of worker (`cow`), `race`, and household information like `microwave`, `dishwasher`, `tvcable`, `singlefamilyhome`, and `npeople` (number of people in the household)


## Purchase Patterns

We'll explore the purchase patterns in the dataset. This includes understanding the most popular brands, the average quantity purchased, and spending habits across different markets. Here are some specific analyses we can perform:

- Calculate the total quantity and spending for each brand.

- Find the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase.

- Compare the total spending across different markets.

I'll begin with these analyses and create visualizations to help us understand the data better. Let's start by calculating the total quantity and spending for each brand.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Reading the CSV file
beer_data = pd.read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv")

# Setting up the visualisation settings
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Calculate total quantity and spending for each brand
brand_summary = beer_data.groupby('brand').agg({'quantity':'sum', 'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()

# Sort by total quantity and spending
brand_summary_sorted_quantity = brand_summary.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)
brand_summary_sorted_spent = brand_summary.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)

```

```{python}
# Plotting total quantity for each brand
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.barplot(x='quantity', y='brand', data=brand_summary_sorted_quantity, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Total Quantity of Beer Purchased by Brand')
plt.xlabel('Total Quantity')
plt.ylabel('Brand')
plt.show()

# Plotting total spending for each brand
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='brand', data=brand_summary_sorted_spent, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Brand')
plt.xlabel('Total Spending')
plt.ylabel('Brand')
plt.show()
```

The bar charts above display the total quantity of beer purchased and the total spending by brand. From the looks of it, certain brands dominate in terms of quantity sold and total spending, indicating their popularity.


Now, let's calculate the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase. For this, we'll consider each row in the dataset as a separate purchase and compute the averages accordingly.

```{python}
# Calculate average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase
average_purchase = beer_data.groupby('brand').agg({
    'quantity': 'mean', 
    'dollar_spent': 'mean'
}).reset_index()

# Sort by average quantity and average spending
average_purchase_sorted_quantity = average_purchase.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)
average_purchase_sorted_spent = average_purchase.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)

# Plotting average quantity for each brand
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.barplot(x='quantity', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_quantity, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Average Quantity of Beer Purchased by Brand')
plt.xlabel('Average Quantity')
plt.ylabel('Brand')
plt.show()

# Plotting average spending for each brand
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_spent, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Average Spending on Beer by Brand')
plt.xlabel('Average Spending')
plt.ylabel('Brand')
plt.show()

```
The visualizations above depict the average quantity of beer purchased per brand and the average spending per brand. This shows which brands tend to be bought in larger quantities on average and which brands tend to have higher spending per purchase, which could be indicative of their price point or the purchase of premium products.


## Demographic Analysis

We will examine which demographics are buying what kind of beer and whether spending habits vary by demographics such as age, employment, and race. For this, we could look at:

- Spending by age group
- Spending by employment status
- Spending by race

I'll start by analyzing spending by age group.

```{python}
# Calculate total spending by age group
age_group_spending = beer_data.groupby('age').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()

# Sort by total spending
age_group_spending_sorted = age_group_spending.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)

# Plotting total spending by age group
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='age', data=age_group_spending_sorted, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Age Group')
plt.xlabel('Total Spending')
plt.ylabel('Age Group')
plt.show()

```

The bar chart demonstrates the total spending on beer segmented by age group, highlighting which age groups spend the most on beer. It appears that certain age groups are more dominant in beer spending, which may align with the purchasing power or preferences of those groups.

Next, we will examine spending by employment status.

```{python}
# Calculate total spending by employment status
employment_spending = beer_data.groupby('employment').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()

# Sort by total spending
employment_spending_sorted = employment_spending.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)

# Plotting total spending by employment status
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='employment', data=employment_spending_sorted, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Employment Status')
plt.xlabel('Total Spending')
plt.ylabel('Employment Status')
plt.show()

```
The visualization shows the total spending on beer by employment status. We can see that certain employment groups, such as full-time workers, are spending more on beer, which might be related to their disposable income.
