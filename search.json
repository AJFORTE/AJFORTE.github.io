From the looks of it, certain brands dominate in terms of quantity sold and total spending, indicating their popularity.\nNow, let‚Äôs calculate the average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase. For this, we‚Äôll consider each row in the dataset as a separate purchase and compute the averages accordingly.\n\n# Calculate average quantity purchased and average spending per purchase\naverage_purchase = beer_data.groupby('brand').agg({\n    'quantity': 'mean', \n    'dollar_spent': 'mean'\n}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by average quantity and average spending\naverage_purchase_sorted_quantity = average_purchase.sort_values('quantity', ascending=False)\naverage_purchase_sorted_spent = average_purchase.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting average quantity for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='quantity', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_quantity, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Quantity of Beer Purchased by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Quantity')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n# Plotting average spending for each brand\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='brand', data=average_purchase_sorted_spent, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Average Spending on Beer by Brand')\nplt.xlabel('Average Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Brand')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe visualizations above depict the average quantity of beer purchased per brand and the average spending per brand. This shows which brands tend to be bought in larger quantities on average and which brands tend to have higher spending per purchase, which could be indicative of their price point or the purchase of premium products.\nNext, we‚Äôll look at the total spending across different markets to see if there are any notable differences in spending habits geographically. To do this, we‚Äôll sum up the spending in each market and visualize it.\n\n# Calculate total spending in each market\nmarket_spending_summary = beer_data.groupby('market').agg({'dollar_spent':'sum'}).reset_index()\n\n# Sort by total spending\nmarket_spending_summary_sorted = market_spending_summary.sort_values('dollar_spent', ascending=False)\n\n# Plotting total spending in each market\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.barplot(x='dollar_spent', y='market', data=market_spending_summary_sorted, palette='viridis')\nplt.title('Total Spending on Beer by Market')\nplt.xlabel('Total Spending')\nplt.ylabel('Market')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the total spending on beer by market, showcasing the differences in spending habits across various regions. Some markets have significantly higher spending, which could be due to a variety of factors including market size, consumer preferences, or economic factors.\nNow, let‚Äôs move on to the second analysis:"

As I take my first step into the digital realm, I‚Äôm excited to share my journey, experiences, and insights on this platform.\n\n\n\nMy pursuit of knowledge in the field of Accounting kicked off in August 2022 when I enrolled at SUNY Geneseo. The path to a B.S. in Accounting has been nothing short of exhilarating. From the intricacies of financial statements to the complexities of taxation, every class has been a stepping stone towards a more profound understanding of the financial world.\nBut the journey doesn‚Äôt stop there. With an expected graduation date in May 2026, I am determined to leverage my education to make a tangible impact in the world of finance. The ultimate goal? Attaining the coveted Certified Public Accountant (CPA) designation, a milestone that represents not just professional competence but a commitment to the highest standards of integrity and ethics.\n\n\n\nWhile the academic realm shapes my mind, I find balance in the world outside textbooks. One of my greatest joys is spending quality time with friends, forging connections beyond the classroom. These relationships not only provide a welcome respite from the rigors of academia but also contribute to my personal growth.\nAnd then there‚Äôs basketball ‚Äì a sport that has been a constant companion throughout my life. Whether it‚Äôs playing pickup at the park or getting involved with my school‚Äôs club team, basketball is more than just a pastime for me. It‚Äôs a metaphor for teamwork, strategy, and perseverance, qualities that transcend the court and seamlessly integrate into the fabric of life.\n\n\n\nAs I navigate the academic landscape, I‚Äôve also had the privilege of gaining real-world experience. Currently, I serve as an Administrator at a Dermatologist‚Äôs office, where my role extends beyond the realms of accounting. This internship has been a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, providing me with insights into the day-to-day operations of a business.\nThis blog will serve as a chronicle of my journey ‚Äì a mix of academic insights, personal reflections, and anecdotes from the professional sphere. I invite you to join me on this adventure as I strive for academic excellence, seek personal growth, and navigate the intricate world of accounting.\nThank you for stepping into my virtual space.

    "text": "Purchase Patterns\nWe‚Äôll delve into the relationship between playlist position (pos) and the ten most popular artists in the spotify dataset. The analysis involves identifying and ranking these artists based on their frequency of occurrence. Here are key insights derived from the subsequent histogram visualization:\n\nDistribution Pattern\nEarly Playlist Placement\nConsistency Across Artists\n\nThis analysis provides valuable insights into user preferences regarding the positioning of songs by popular artists within playlists, shedding light on the dynamics of playlist curation. The next steps will involve further exploration and visualizations to deepen our understanding of these patterns. Let‚Äôs continue the exploration by examining average quantity purchased and spending habits per purchase across brands.\n\nbest_artists &lt;- spotify_data %&gt;% \n  group_by(artist_name) %&gt;% \n  mutate(n_popular_artist = n()) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  mutate( artist_ranking = dense_rank( desc(n_popular_artist) ) ) %&gt;% \n  filter( artist_ranking &lt;= 10) \n\n\nggplot(best_artists,\n       aes(x = pos, y = fct_reorder(artist_name, -artist_ranking)) ) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(\n    fun = mean,\n    color = 'red'\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThe provided ggplot code generates a boxplot to visualize the distribution of the variable pos (position of a song in a playlist) across different artists in the Q1c dataset. The y-axis is reordered based on the ranking of artists (artist_ranking), displaying the data for each artist in a descending order.\nPosition Spread: The boxplot shows the distribution of pos values for each artist, providing a visual representation of the spread and central tendency of playlist positions.\nMedian Line: The line inside each box represents the median position of songs for the respective artist.\nInterquartile Range (IQR): The boxes indicate the IQR, depicting the range where the majority of playlist positions lie.\nOutliers: Any points beyond the whiskers of the boxplot are considered outliers, showing instances where playlist positions deviate significantly from the norm for a given artist.\nNow, this next plot will show the relationship between playlist positions and the duration of the tracks\n\nggplot(spotify_data, aes(x = pos, y = duration_ms)) +\n  geom_point(color = 'blue', alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = 'Scatter Plot of Playlist Positions and Track Durations',\n       x = 'Playlist Position',\n       y = 'Track Duration (ms)') +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(scale = 1e-3, suffix = 's'))\n\n\n\n\nThis scatter plot visualizes the relationship between playlist positions (pos) and track durations (duration_ms). Each point represents a track, and the color and transparency add a visual flair to the distribution.\nNext, we‚Äôll look at the top 5 artist on Spotify solely judged by their playlist frequency\n\ntop_artists &lt;- spotify_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(artist_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(playlist_count = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(playlist_count)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 5)\n\nggplot(top_artists, aes(x = fct_reorder(artist_name, playlist_count), y = playlist_count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = 'green') +\n  labs(title = 'Top 5 Artists by Playlist Frequency',\n       x = 'Artist Name',\n       y = 'Number of Playlists')\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart identifies and visualizes the top 10 artists with the highest playlist frequency. It uses the artist_name variable to create a bar chart showing the number of playlists each artist appears in. The bars are color-coded for better distinction."
